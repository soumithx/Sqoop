--username sqoop
--password sqoop
--tables  cities 
--hive-import

The biggest advantage of using Sqoop for populating tables in Hive is that it can auto‐
matically populate the metadata for you.

if the table in hive does not exist,sqoop will create it based on metadata fetched from your table.if the table already exists sqoop wil import the data 

in sqoop to hive ,conversion is straight forward VARCHAR,CHAR to string 

default mapping does not work some times... 
--map-column-hive id=String,price=DECIMAL

during hive import sqoop will do normal hdfs import to a temporary location.After Sucessful import sqoop generates two queries one for creating table and another one is loading data from a temporary location. 
		 use --target-dir or --warehouse-dir 


--> if the table is exist already,it will append newly imported data.

--> to overwrite that data, we can use a parameter 
		--hive-overwrite ,which wil instruct sqoop to truncate an existing hive table,and load only the newly imported one,
 to refresh the hive table on periodical basic is parameter is very helpfull.
