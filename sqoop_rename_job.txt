all map reduce jobs are name under QueryResult.jar,it's very hard to see which map reduce job belongs to which imported query,

we can overcome this problem by --mapreduce-job-name normicites 


sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com/sqoop \
--username sqoop \
--password sqoop \
--query 'SELECT normcities.id, \
countries.country, \
normcities.city \
FROM normcities \
JOIN countries USING(country_id) \
WHERE $CONDITIONS' \
--split-by id \
--target-dir cities \
--mapreduce-job-name normcities
