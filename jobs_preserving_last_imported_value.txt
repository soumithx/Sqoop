every time we need to remember last import value,thats a tough task for us.to over come this problem there is concept call jobs,

we can take advantage of built-in sqoop metastore that allows you to save all parameters for later use.

sqoop job \
--create visits \
-- \
import 
--connect jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com/sqop \
--username sqoop \
--password sqoop \
--table visits \
--increment append \
--check-column id \
--last-value 0

A job can start with        -----> sqoop job --exec visits
retain job list with        -----> sqoop job --list 
Remove the job with         -----> sqoop job --delete visits 
saved job definiations      -----> sqoop job --show visits 


way, users do not need to
remember the last imported value after each execution; everything is handled auto‚Äê
matically.
